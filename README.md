# OPak
A cool little package manager I made for fun to download and install all my cool terminal games and programs

## SYSTEM SUPPORT
This program currently only supports Linux and MacOS (Sorry not sorry Windows lol).

## How to install
Download opak-installer.sh
Go into terminal and type
> sudo chmod +x opak-installer.sh
>
> ./opak-installer.sh

Done!
Now you can type
> opak -h

for the help file
